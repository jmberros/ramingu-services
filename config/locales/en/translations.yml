    google_title: Google Young Cyber Lion
    google_description: "Gifts are better when they have a story behind them –the
      better the story, the more special the gift. Unfortunately, consumers think
      buying things online is cold and distant. We want to reconcile these two factors
      in a way that is engaging, incentivizes users to buy products online, and encourages
      them to share their experience. “Memory Lanes” implements a variety of Google
      platforms (Google Street view, Google+, Google Maps API, and Hangouts) to personalize
      the online shopping experience. Consumers can customize Street View in a way
      that enhances the story behind the gift they give.\nThis was a campaign produced
      for the 2014 Cannes Young Cyber Lion competition. "

    worldcup_description: Similar to Chat Roulette in that online chatters are paired
      up randomly and have the option to click out of a conversation with someone,
      fans with the proper A/V resources are given 10 seconds to tell a person of
      the opposing team off while they watch the game in real-time.
