      description: "Gifts are better when they have a story behind them –the better
        the story, the more special the gift. Unfortunately, consumers think buying
        things online is cold and distant. We want to reconcile these two factors
        in a way that is engaging, incentivizes users to buy products online, and
        encourages them to share their experience. “Memory Lanes” implements a variety
        of Google platforms (Google Street view, Google+, Google Maps API, and Hangouts)
        to personalize the online shopping experience. Consumers can customize Street
        View in a way that enhances the story behind the gift they give.\nThis was
        a campaign produced for the 2014 Cannes Young Cyber Lion competition. "

        world's toughest questions, but actively seek them out. People that are driven
        by curiosity and passion. This employer branding campaign was not used by
        Siemens.

        randomly and have the option to click out of a conversation with someone,
        fans with the proper A/V resources are given 10 seconds to tell a person of
        the opposing team off while they watch the game in real-time.
