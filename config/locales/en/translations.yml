    google_title: Google Young Cyber Lion
    google_description: "Gifts are better when they have a story behind them –the
      better the story, the more special the gift. Unfortunately, consumers think
      buying things online is cold and distant. We want to reconcile these two factors
      in a way that is engaging, incentivizes users to buy products online, and encourages
      them to share their experience. “Memory Lanes” implements a variety of Google
      platforms (Google Street view, Google+, Google Maps API, and Hangouts) to personalize
      the online shopping experience. Consumers can customize Street View in a way
      that enhances the story behind the gift they give.\nThis was a campaign produced
      for the 2014 Cannes Young Cyber Lion competition. "

      by Siemens.

    worldcup_description: Similar to Chat Roulette in that online chatters are paired
      up randomly and have the option to click out of a conversation with someone,
      fans with the proper A/V resources are given 10 seconds to tell a person of
      the opposing team off while they watch the game in real-time.

    bio: 'I am a New Jerseyan born of a Colombian mum and a Cuban dad. I have spoken
      both English and Spanish my whole life. On top of that, I have lived in Argentina
      for three years. I have a bachelor in Comparative Literature and I write with
      gusto. You can say language is my bitch, motherfucker. So you can''t go wrong
      with our translation service: blazingly fast, ninja-precise, and faithful to
      the concept of the text.'

      the essence of what you are trying to communicate will not be lost.
